# Deadline Calendar

## 1. What will the application do?  

This application can record deadline and show it.

## 2. Who will use it?
Students who think the calendar of *Canvas* is not enough.

## 3. Why is this project of interest to you?
- I am not in Canada now, so it is not convenient to check the deadline of my assignment in the calendar of *Canvas* and a local deadline Calendar can be opened easily.
- Different courses use lots of different web platforms to upload homework, prelab, etc. 
Most of them will not show in *Canvas*, so I would like to write program to record all of them.

# Phase 4: Task 2
Make appropriate use of the Map interface somewhere in your code. 
I use this in the 24 line in the ChangeFrameDemo.java

# Phase 4: Task 3
1. If I have more time, I will enhance the JPanelWithCalendar, and move more function from its subclass to it .
